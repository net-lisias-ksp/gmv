title = G1 Drill O'Matic Junior Mining Excavator Kit
manufacturer = Kerbal Standard
description = The G1 Drill O'Matic Junior Kit is a refitting of the original issue for the G1 set. It's fixed on the bed with reinforced armatures as well as a resource tank of its own fitted beside it above the vehicle bed. As it is a refitted version of its original counterpart, it is still suitable for ore concentrations in excess of 2.5%. The operating procedures are the same as well, so any skilled engineer will know how to operate it with better efficiency all the same. The reinforced armature has enhanced cooling and insulation as well as built-in radiator on the moving platform where the drill is located.
